This repo contains my ui.R and server.R files that run my yearly toilet roll usage forecasting model

In order to get your yearly toilet roll usage forecast, simply select your weekly toilet roll usage from the drop-down box. You will notice that the default value is 1, but you can select a number up to and including 10.

Once the "Submit" button is pressed, you will receive your yearly forecast. The forecast covers yearly usage, the amount of toilet paper that your usage equates to (in both miles and also square feet), as well as the total dollar cost.
